# Dick's Drive-in Calculator

[Dick's Drive-In](http://www.ddir.com/) is a Seattle institution; a simple menu and an endless source of juvenile jokes, Seattle loves its Dick's.

There used to be a site that did this very thing (http://www.dicksinmymouth.com) but as of early July 2016, it's not responding. And even if it _were_, I'd still do this for the practice of doing all these tasks (tallying items, accessing object properties via another property, etc.).

*14-July-2016* Today marks the end of work on version 1. I have [ideas!](../../issues) about future iterations, but for the time being, I'll move on to another project. (: 

## Resources

* [Dick's Drive-in Menu](http://www.ddir.com/menu) with prices! :tada:

  :warning: this might not be applicable! Research trip needed. :grimacing:   
  _Update:_ as of 14-July, I'm going with no sales tax, but as soon as I _can_ make the research trip, heh, I'll update if necessary. 
* Messing about with colors using [Spectral](http://jxnblk.com/Spectral/#fc5000&hues=3&rows=2&shiftS=-0.1&shiftL=-0.1) and [Paletton](http://paletton.com/#uid=c0h351o3z0kw0vCjECRoZxTyhoDDvjm)
