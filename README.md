# Dick's Drive-in Calculator

[Dick's Drive-In](http://www.ddir.com/) is a Seattle institution; a simple menu and an endless source of juvenile jokes, Seattle loves its Dick's.

There used to be a site that did this very thing (http://www.dicksinmymouth.com) but as of early July 2016, it's not responding. And even if it _were_, I'd still do this for the practice of doing all these tasks (tallying items, accessing object properties via another property, etc.).
